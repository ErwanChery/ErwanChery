Welcome on my profile.

# A little bit about myself

I'm a french full stack web developper.

I love Laravel and naturally tried most of the associated frameworks, i.e vuejs, inertiajs or livewire
I'm a big fan of Livewire (+ Filament) and the TALL stack ! ❤️

I'm currently collaborating with a friend on creating a recruitement agency, as so, I'm doing the website and the back office using the TALL stack obviously 😊

I love challenges, and challenged myself to do a triathlon, and not just any triathlon but an Iron Man ! 😍
